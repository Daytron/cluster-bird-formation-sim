## Cluster Bird Formations Simulation ##
### Description ###
A Python application for simulating cluster formation of bird flight patterns such as V and circle formations. This is just a demonstration of clustering behaviour in the field Artificial Intelligence. This is initially created for Codeskulptor ([http://www.codeskulptor.org/](http://www.codeskulptor.org/)) but now uses **SimpleGUICS2Pygame** module.

### Requirements ###
- Python 2.7
- Pygame
- SimpleGUICS2Pygame ([https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleGUICS2Pygame](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleGUICS2Pygame))


### Usage ###
    python birds_sim.py
Ignore the console and go straight to the frame window. Click on the canvas to spawn a bird. Continue clicking to produce more, up to 8 birds. 
<br><br>
Birds will follow the "leader" and create a V formation as default. You can also change the formation in mid-air as you wish by clicking the 'Circle Formation' button. Feel free to adjust the radius of the circle formation or the distance between birds in V formation using the corresponding buttons.
